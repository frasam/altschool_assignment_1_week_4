 <h3 id="why">Why I join Altschool </h3>
    <p>My name is Ekejuba Samuel Izuchukwu, and I recently gained admission to study Frontend Software Engineering at AltSchool Africa. Coming from a background in Business Administration and currently working as an Office Assistant at Chibume Venture, I’ve always had a deep curiosity about how technology shapes the modern business world. Over time, this curiosity evolved into a strong desire to become a part of the tech ecosystem — not just as a user but as a creator and problem-solver.

    <p>I chose AltSchool because it offers a practical, hands-on approach to learning software development, with a curriculum that is industry-relevant and community-driven. AltSchool provides not only the technical skills required to build user-friendly, functional web applications, but also mentors, peer support, and real-world project exposure that make the learning experience impactful.</p>

Joining AltSchool is a bold step towards that future — one that aligns with my ambition, values, and the changing dynamics of work in the digital age.</p> 

    <p>This journey is both exciting and challenging, and I’m fully committed to making the most of it. I believe that with discipline, consistency, and the right guidance, I’ll emerge as a capable and innovative frontend engineer ready to make a difference.</p>
